Even when you are going through a lot, continuing to pave your own way & facing it all by yourself,you still make time to talk with me and keep me involved in your life. Even though there are sometimes where we may go without talking for sometime & where you need time for yourself. I know that you will always be there for me & that actually means a lot knowing Im important enough to be in your life even as you move further with yours.  I appreciate you so much & thank you for sticking it out with me. I just want you to know that your heart has the essence of purity,you are worthy,you are kind,you do deserve a lot & Im proud of you with every step you are rising on, you are doing great, you are unique... I will be there for you like you value me, for the best✨, I will make sure you are okay,I will rub your back & tell you it wll be okay, I will hold your hands in mine,let you cry. I will be there even if it isnt gonna be the pretty moments all the time. Lotss of lovee to youu🌹💞 & definelty not gonna stop annoying you💃🕺😉🥰💗take-care, love you urja🌹😚🥰🥰🥳✨ <3');
